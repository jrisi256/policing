```{r, include = F}
library(knitr)
opts_chunk$set(message = F, echo = F, warning = F)

library(here)
source(here("functions.R"))

# Read in data
path <- paste("clean-and-process", "output", sep = "/")
stops <- my_read_csv(here(path, "stops_officers_assignments_risi_min.csv"))
arrests <- my_read_csv(here(path, "arrests_officers_assignments_risi_min.csv"))
force <- my_read_csv(here(path, "force_officers_assignments_risi_min.csv"))

rstops <- stops %>% filter(!is.na(stop_id))
rarrests <- arrests %>% filter(!is.na(arrest_id))
rforce <- force %>% filter(!is.na(force_id))
```

## Number of observations

For each outcome (stops, arrests, and uses of force), the resulting data frame is a representation of every shift assignment along with any outcomes which occurred during the shift. Any shift which did not have an outcome associated with it is still captured in the data frame, but it has a missing value for all columns associated with the outcome (e.g., stop_id).

### Stops

* Number of total rows: `r nrow(stops)`
* Number of shift assignments: `r length(unique(stops$shift_id))`
    * Number of stop incidents: `r length(unique(stops$stop_id))`
    * Number of shift assignments of with a recorded stop: `r length(unique(rstops$shift_id))`
    * Proportion of shifts with a recorded stop: `r length(unique(rstops$shift_id)) / length(unique(stops$shift_id))`
* Number of officers: `r length(unique(stops$officer_id))`
    * Number of officers with a recorded stop: `r length(unique(rstops$officer_id))`
    * Proportion of officers with a recorded stop: `r length(unique(rstops$officer_id)) / length(unique(stops$officer_id))`

### Arrests

* Number of total rows: `r nrow(arrests)`
* Number of shift assignments: `r length(unique(arrests$shift_id))`
    * Number of arrest incidents: `r length(unique(arrests$arrest_id))`
    * Number of shift assignments of with a recorded arrest: `r length(unique(rarrests$shift_id))`
    * Proportion of shifts with a recorded stop: `r length(unique(rarrests$shift_id)) / length(unique(stops$shift_id))`
* Number of officers: `r length(unique(arrests$officer_id))`
    * Number of officers with a recorded arrest: `r length(unique(rarrests$officer_id))`
    * Proportion of officers with a recorded stop: `r length(unique(rarrests$officer_id)) / length(unique(stops$officer_id))`

### Uses Of Force

* Number of total rows: `r nrow(force)`
* Number of shift assignments: `r length(unique(force$shift_id))`
    * Number of force incidents: `r length(unique(force$force_id))`
    * Number of shift assignments of with a recorded use of force: `r length(unique(rforce$shift_id))`
    * Proportion of shifts with a recorded stop: `r length(unique(rforce$shift_id)) / length(unique(stops$shift_id))`
* Number of officers: `r length(unique(force$officer_id))`
    * Number of officers with a recorded use of force: `r length(unique(rforce$officer_id))`
    * Proportion of officers with a recorded stop: `r length(unique(rforce$officer_id)) / length(unique(stops$officer_id))`

## Create outcomes

First just find the distribution of stops, arrests, and uses of force by shift.

How many shift assignments have a recorded action? Then look at the distribution by shift, subset maybe? Time of day and place? Too much?

How many officers have these recorded actions? Then look at the distribution by officer, subset maybe? Gender, age, race.

Then look to Ba to see what outcomes he is creating and my code to see what I was creating. And then create those outcomes.

```{r}

```

## Replicability

It is important my methods are general enough so that I can re-run them, if need be, on all of my data.
