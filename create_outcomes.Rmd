## Libraries

```{r}

```

## Read in packages

```{r}

```

## Some basic number rundowns

As in the number of observatons and what each observation entails... what does the data frame represent?

```{r}

```

## Create outcomes

First just find the distribution of stops, arrests, and uses of force by shift.

How many shift assignments have a recorded action? Then look at the distribution by shift, subset maybe? Time of day and place? Too much?

How many officers have these recorded actions? Then look at the distribution by officer, subset maybe? Gender, age, race.

Then look to Ba to see what outcomes he is creating and my code to see what I was creating. And then create those outcomes.

```{r}

```

## Replicability

It is important my methods are general enough so that I can re-run them, if need be, on all of my data.
